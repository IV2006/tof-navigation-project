The goal in the project: Given an infra-red mapping of a closed (?) space with a living organism inside, the drone needs to fly towards a human in space. – useful in military applications.
The sub-goals in achieving this:
1) map the space using infra-red photos.
  1.1) stay in the same place and take a 2π scan of the room in all directions.
  1.2) map the space.
  1.3) find the target.
2) fly towards the most human-like object.
  2.1) if can fly directly towards the target – do so.
  2.2) otherwise search for an exit that will allow passage.
3) iterate until contact (or close enough).
