The goal of the project is to manage to find the exit of a room and navigate there. WE DID NOT MANAGE TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL.

For a covering of the algorithms we developed and implemented, see: reports/overall_report.pdf

For a final results run example see: [examples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dWF2xcFh5AZ28KtAkpqv94Ip5uq_YNXX?usp=drive_link), we recommad watching at increased speed since due to the way our navigation algorithm works, the movment is quite slow. In the first example the exit was found but we failed to navigate to it, in the second example the exit wasn't found. The two images show the points for successfull runs (where the exit was found).
